Drive along the road.  Or don't.

This is a simple scrolling demo in pygame.  It has no real purpose, unless
you like scrolling.

---------- History ----------
One weekend I wanted to play around with some game ideas, to see if they 
were super-awesome or boring.  I needed a simple framework to prototype 
them on, so I whipped one out.  Then I sketched up some art.  And made an 
installer.  

And totally forgot to play around my original game ideas.  

Damn.  Maybe next time.

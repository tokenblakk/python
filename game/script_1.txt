You wake up, throat sore. 
Time for work.
You look at the clock: 6:45 AM
Shit, You're late.
This isn't the first time, who wants to wake up to this when dreams are so free?
Clothes on.
You squeeze what little toothpaste you have onto the frayed stick that you call a toothbrush
Stare at yourself in the mirror and do your best zombie impression
...
...
"MARRUUGGGGGHHH"
Yeah that was good.
You silently applaud your zombie impression and briefly consider acting.
You think better of it.
You look down at your watch.
...
6:52.
...
"MARRRRRGGHHH!"
"The boss is going to have my head for this" you think to yourself...
You roll back the curtain from your little corner of space the boss let you live in the back room of the club. 
Rats. Roaches. Spiders...
Actually you got used to the spiders, they drew some nice designs for you to stare at as you fall asleep. 
...
...
"LATE!"
As soon as you lift the curtain from the back room your boss shoves you to the bar. 
"Clean these glasses, NOW."
"6:30 means 6:30. Not 6:45. not 6:53."
"You slip up you're outta here, you hear me!"
"Yeah." - Was all you decide to say
The boss was a funny looking man. He wore a short haircut that made him look like a girl, he had a very round face and whenever he got angry he would sweat.
...
This was not the usual sweat today, this morning it was thick, almost like you could reach out and grab a handful. It made his face look like clay, almost unreal.
But the spit was the same. 
Now after thoroughly drenching you with spit and sweat, the boss decides to let you get to work.
Work....
You'd think there was something better out there to do.
Something exciting.
Something that didn't feel like turning off your brain for 8-12 hours a day, every day.
"Maybe I could do something with my hands.." You think to yourself...
...
...
...
...
"I'll take a Stella."
A tall man sits down at the bar. It's 7:20 AM. He is the only one there.

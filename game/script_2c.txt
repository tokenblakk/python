"Alright kid I'm going around the side. Look around the back of the building for a way in. I'll text you the security codes once you're in. Just come to the side and unlock the door. Got it? Now keep a sharp eye out, I got a feeling we ain't alone."

Sitting in the darkness, you start to remember your boss and how your day started. Now here you are, not even 24 hours later.....

"I can definitely appreciate the change of pace I guess." you thought to yourself.

His watch.
The kid snapped out of whatever he was daydreaming about. His watch told him it was 2 AM so nightdreaming he figured.
Scanning around he was able to see a few possibilities...

1) The window. It was really high up but he saw a garbage can right below he could probably use...

2) In the very dark corner of the building there seemed to be an airduct hidden in the shadows. Just his size. It'll be a tight fit though...

3) The back door, it could set off an alarm..

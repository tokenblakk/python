The kid rounded towards the small shaft. 
I can fit in there! 
The kid lifted the grate out of the way and wriggled his way into the dar tunnel...
...
...
Halfway through he ran into a large metal screen. 
It was filtering the air in the building...and it was filthy!
That strange stuff that cab driver was smoking was brought into the kid's mind.
Suddenly he felt it was very hard to breathe. 
He began wheezing, coughing, turned around and hurried to scrable out of the vents. 
...
...
As he rolled out of the shaft the kid looked around the alleyway. 
He looked towards the door and felt very frightened.
It was open.
It was wide open. 
No time to ponder he thought.
...
Getting to his feet he ran through the open door and shut it behind him. 

Inside, the kid let his eyes focus on how very little light was in the room after he closed the door. 
He could see the locked window as well as a ventilation duct connected to the room. As he began to look around he felt something in his pocket...
*Buzz Buzz Buzz*

*Buzz Buzz Buzz*
...

It was a text message!
From Marshall...Where was he?
Did he open this door?
All the text said was [1876].
Was this a code?
Maybe he needed to enter it somewhere...
Before he could look around more, he saw it.
...
Dimly glowing in the darkness there was 1 computer monitor.
On the monitor was the word [CODE:] followed by a text prompt.

This was where he needed to go.
What was that code again?
He checked his phone...

"Yeah, I really wanna drink, but the boss..."
"FUCK THE BOSS!"

"Here kid, chug this one right now."
"What?? No!"
"Do it! I'm a paying customer! Do you want me to go into the back and ask your boss why he won't do what paying customers request??"

"Asshole..."
"Hahah, now chug!"
*Glug glug glug glug*

Then it happened.

...
*BANG!*
"WHERE'S MY MONEY MOTHERFUCKER!!"
The voices were coming from the back room.
...
...
"SAVINO DON'T FUCK WITH ME! NO MORE EXTENSIONS"
Boss always had a way with people. Looks like his gambling caught up with him today...
...
...
*BANG BANG BANG*
3 shots, loud, coming from where Boss was talking.

...
2 men, masked walked from the back room and out the front door.
They looked at you and Marshall as they swept out of the room. 
8 AM, and my boss was already dead on the floor.

"Hey kid, Lets get out of here."

It was Marshall. He was riding shotgun in a lowrider whip. 
The kid was in the back.
A rather odd Jamaican fellow was driving. 

"I'll drop you off at the back entrance of this museum."
"It's a big ole scary scooby doo night at the museum type museum too." piped in the black man driving.
"I'll send you a text once you get in."

"Alright now there's two ways in there, but one might be guarded." 
"There is usually a camera looking at the back door but we'll be sure to disable it on the as soon as you get there so don't worry about it."
"You should be able to just walk through the door no problem."

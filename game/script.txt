Welcome. This is a story about how one child grew to save the world.
We begin in a dark tavern, devoid of all goodness you'd find in a church or
elementary school. No, this was the underworld, where the slimiest goons
and rachetest thugs reside. This is the birthplace of you. 
You were raised here, cleaning bathrooms and mopping up spills.
Picking up broken glasses, debris, bullets.
But this is the place you escaped.

That night, a customer came in: tall, round, with a gleaming bald head and a 
hook earring in his left ear. He sits down for a drink "White Russian" and
you scurry to get him a beverage. He looks you in the eye, says "Ain't you 
a little young to be workin' the bar kid?"

You say: 
1)I just turned 12, I could drink a beer if I wanted
2)Maybe a little, I just do whatever Boss says...
3)...

1)"Wow tough guy huh? Well have a shot eh? .... Strong stuff right?"
2)"Well take a shot, loosen up a bit kid, you cant go around doin' what 
everybody tells ya"
3)"Ah don't be shy kid, I don't bite"

"Anyways, I'm Marshal, I'm in the need of a partner, someone small, sprightly.
You look just the type. I promise I'm no kiddy raper, I gots
me a family back home. So whaddya say huh, gonna stop working in this
pisshole eh?"

Then out of nowhere: Gunshots - Coming from the back. You look and see Boss, 
your caretaker with his brains blown out. A bloody mess splattered all
across the floor. Three gunmen emerge from the back in masks. They have
flamethrowers. Flamethrowers, you might ask. Yes, you see bandits have
attempted to rob this tavern for decades. Mere handguns won't do any good.
The main thug, a bit smaller than the rest, with dreadlocks coming out of
his mask starts shouting "YOU MOTHERFUCKERS BETTER GET DOWN!"

He walks around while everyone just stares back, coldly eyeing this guy 
with a pistol in one hand and a lit flamethrower in the other.

"Now, I will make this easy. We're looking for a child by the name of "
********
"If anyone knows where we can find this kid, well we don't want things
to get ugly now do we?"

You gasp, and the gunmen look your way. "Oh lookie here, what's your name
kid?"

1)******
2)*Lie* "It's Abraham Lincoln"
3)...

1)"-The Kid's with me"
2)"Heyyy, We got a smartass over here fellas, You know what we do with
smartasses?"
3)"Ah, nah don't be shy. Speak Up!"

"The Kid's with me" Marshal stood up and grabs you by the arm. 
"We were just on our way out."

"Oh, not so fast mon"
"Gimmie deh kid."

Marshal quick as lightning unholsters two guns and shoots the two goons
dead in the head. Both aimed now towards the leader.

"Try asking nicely"

The dreaded thug reaches for his flamethrower and begins to spray hot flames
in your direction.

Marshal throws you under the bar and takes aim.

Pow. ......... Bang! A huge explosion ripples inside the dusty tavern
and throws Marshal over the bar counter and crashing into the glasses. 


Debris settles and you open your eyes. You see the full moon shine through what was
once the roof of the tavern. There is charred wood everywhere. 
Ash fills the air.
You cough, hard. Harder, harder you cough until you begin to black out
Strange, you feel yourself rising, moving...The cold air against your skin.

"No Way Man."
"What???"
...
...
"Don't be a pussy..."
"Whatever..."
...
"The name's Marshall."
...
...
...
...
...
Then it happened.
...
...
...
*BANG!*
"WHERE'S MY MONEY MOTHERFUCKER!!"
The voices were coming from the back room.
...
...
"SAVINO DON'T FUCK WITH ME! NO MORE EXTENSIONS"
Boss always had a way with people. Looks like his gambling caught up with him today...
...
...
*BANG BANG BANG*
3 shots, loud, coming from where Boss was talking. 
...
...
2 men, masked walked from the back room and out the front door.
They looked at you and Marshall as they swept out of the room. 
8 AM, and my boss was already dead on the floor.

"Hey kid, Lets get out of here."

ImageCrop2_6
============

A tool I created to crop my screenshots down to 1920x1080.
I have 3 monitors of different resolutions and my main monitor is in the center. 

WARNING: This program removes the source image, if you intend to save the originals, it is
recommended you copy images to the source folder.

This program requires a source folder specified For me it is X:/Photos/Crop
The processed images will be placed in a new folder called /Results in your source folder.


This program uses Pillow, a fork of PIL

Available here:
https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow

Extract "PIL/" into your C:/Python26/Lib/site-packages/ folder  (For windows, other operating systems may vary)
Happy Cropping
